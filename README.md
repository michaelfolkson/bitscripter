# Bitcoin Script Runner

Just enter a bitcoin script, similar to that you can do here: 

https://siminchen.github.io/bitcoinIDE/build/editor.html

## Data

The data is just a couple JSON files, for now.

Probably could move to ReDiS later, I guess.

## Server

The backend code is written in Python 3.

To work on the backend code, you need to create and 
activate the Python 3 virtual environment as follows: 

    python3 -m venv bitscripter
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Frontend

This will just be a form submission, for now, with
"templated" HTML.

## Contributing

I'm going to try using this as an excuse to try Radicle. 

Because I'm sick of
getting [banned for silly shit](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/378976/unexplained-clutter-in-a-post-edited-back-in-by-author)
from various things.

Anyway, once you've installed it, and gotten me to add
you to the repository try this:

`git clone rad://hnrkftsmm5xmems7npgoai6iiswaddaxmz4no.git`
